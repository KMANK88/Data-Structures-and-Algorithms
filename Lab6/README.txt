Part 2
===========================
The odds that a probe will land on a function that is new and not colliding with one is 1- probability(first key has no collisions) * prob(second key has no collisions)     
* . . . * prob(Nth key has no collisions. 

I think that it shows that the larger the value the more of a chance there will be the same chance no matter what the N value is because the table is getting half filled every time. Putting 10^3 and all the other values into the assumption the result was always about 50% every time.  So as long as the array is getting half full every time there is no difference to how big the array is it will always have the same chance.
